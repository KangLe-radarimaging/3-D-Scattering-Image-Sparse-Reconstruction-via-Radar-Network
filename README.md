# 3-D-Scattering-Image-Sparse-Reconstruction-via-Radar-Network

Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) can only provide two-dimensional (2D) images to represent the targetâ€™s scattering projection on the corresponding imaging planes. However, as the echo of target from different observation angles can be achieved simultaneously, radar network is able to provide 3D scattering information about the target. In this paper, a novel 3D scattering image reconstruction method is proposed based on radar network and compressed sensing (CS). Firstly, the general signal model and the reconstruction conditions of radar network 3D reconstruction are given. Then, the 3D scattering distribution reconstruction model is built in a CS framework, which can reconstruct the positions and coefficients of scattering centers simultaneously. Moreover, the sparse structure with three layers in radar network 3D reconstruction is defined and a fast 3D reconstruction algorithm is proposed. To the end, numerical simulations under the noise scenarios and the principal prototype experiments on real data are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.
